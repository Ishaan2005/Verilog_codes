# Verilog HDL Code Repository

This repository contains Verilog HDL codes covering a wide range of digital design topics, from basic combinational logic to finite state machines (FSMs) and testbenches. It is designed as a resource for students, hobbyists, and engineers learning or practicing Verilog.

## 📚 Contents

The repository is organized into the following categories:

### ✅ Combinational Logic
- Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT)
- Multiplexers
- Decoders
- Adders (half adder, full adder, ripple carry adder)
- Subtractors
- Comparators
- Encoders

### 🔁 Sequential Logic
- Latches
- Flip-flops (SR, D, JK, T)
- Registers
- Counters (up, down, up-down)
- Shift registers
- Sequence detectors

### 🚦 Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- Moore FSMs
- Mealy FSMs
- Traffic light controllers
- Elevator controllers
- Pattern detectors

### 🧪 Testbenches
- Testbenches for all modules with sample stimulus
- Includes waveform simulation-ready testbenches
- and much more.......
